  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    This lasagna isn't just a recipe, it's a memory. The scent of simmering
    tomatoes and oregano will transport you right back to Nonna's kitchen,
    where laughter filled the air alongside the rich aroma of slow-cooked
    ragu. Each layer, from the perfectly al dente pasta to the creamy
    béchamel, is infused with the love she poured into every dish. This isn't
    just lasagna; it's a taste of home, a whisper of her loving presence in
    every bite.

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
    <li>
      Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the
      lasagna noodles according to package instructions until they are al
      dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water before draining.
    </li>
    <li>
      Prepare the sauce: In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium
      heat. Add the ground beef or combination of meats, breaking it up with a
      spoon as it cooks. Once browned, add the chopped onions, garlic, celery,
      and tomato paste. Cook until the vegetables are softened, then stir in
      the canned crushed tomatoes, beef broth, dried oregano, bay leaves,
      salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for 20-30 minutes, stirring
      occasionally.
    </li>
    <li>
      Making the béchamel sauce: In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over
      medium heat. Whisk in the all-purpose flour to make a roux, cooking for
      1-2 minutes. Slowly pour in the milk, whisking constantly to prevent
      lumps. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until it thickens,
      stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and stir in the grated Parmesan
      cheese.
    </li>
    <li>
      Assembling the lasagna: Spread a layer of sauce at the bottom of a
      9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 4 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.
    </li>
    <li>
      Laying with ricotta mixture: Spread half of the ricotta cheese over the
      noodles, followed by half of the grated mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
      Repeat this process: layering the remaining noodles, then the remaining
      ricotta cheese, and finally the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan
      cheese.
    </li>
    <li>
      Topping with béchamel sauce and cheese: Pour the béchamel sauce over the
      top layer of cheese. Sprinkle additional Parmesan cheese over the sauce
      for extra flavor.
    </li>
    <li>
      Covering and baking: Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 30
      minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 10-15
      minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
    </li>
    <li>
      Letting it rest: Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for
      10-15 minutes before slicing and serving.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Tips and Variations:</p>
  <p>
    To add extra flavor, sprinkle chopped fresh parsley or basil over the top
    layer of cheese before baking.
  </p>
  <p>
    Consider adding other ingredients to the sauce, such as diced bell peppers
    or mushrooms, for added depth of flavor.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a vegetarian version, substitute the ground beef with sautéed spinach
    and mushrooms.

  <p>Buon appetito!</p>
