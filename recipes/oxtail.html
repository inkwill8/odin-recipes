      <li>Beef broth or stock (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown the
        oxtail on all sides, then remove it from the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the onion, garlic, and scotch bonnet pepper (if using) to the pot
        and stir-fry until softened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the jerk seasoning, brown sugar, soy sauce, lime juice, allspice,
        thyme, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. Stir to combine and bring to a
        boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the oxtail to the pot and cover with a lid. Transfer to the oven
        and cook for 2-3 hours, or until the meat is tender and falls apart
        easily.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the pot from the oven and season with salt and black pepper to
        taste. Serve hot, garnished with chopped scallions and served with rice
        or roti.
